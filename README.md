# repo_collab
This is a test trial for the ALX printf collaboration task with Omokehinde.


We are unfamiliar with git collaborations and this task must be completed with just one of the collaborators having the right to clone this project.

I believe this means the same thing as not forking the project. As a first step, TheOlasunkanmi created this repo and added a README file. I will now proceed to add Omokehinde as a collaborator so he makes the first addition to this project.
